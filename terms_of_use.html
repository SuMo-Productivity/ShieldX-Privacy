        <h1>Terms of Use for ShieldX</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>

        <p>By downloading or using the ShieldX app, these terms automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the app.</p>

        <h2>What ShieldX Does</h2>
        <p>ShieldX is a content blocking and productivity app that helps you manage what you see on your device. The app requires special permissions (like Accessibility Service) to block content and features in other apps as you configure.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>When using ShieldX, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app only for lawful purposes</li>
            <li>Be at least 13 years old (if under 18, you need parent/guardian permission)</li>
            <li>Keep your device secure and not jailbreak/root it (this could break the app)</li>
            <li>Accept app updates when offered</li>
            <li>Pay for any data charges from your mobile carrier</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Can't Do</h2>
        <p>You're not allowed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, or reverse engineer the app</li>
            <li>Extract the source code</li>
            <li>Use the app to harm others or break laws</li>
            <li>Try to hack our systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Premium Features</h2>
        <p>ShieldX may offer premium features through in-app purchases via Google Play Store. All purchases follow Google Play's refund policies. Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel them in your Google Play account settings.</p>

        <h2>Your Data</h2>
        <p>We collect and process your data as described in our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using ShieldX, you agree to our data practices. We use Firebase services for app functionality, which follows Google's privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Ownership</h2>
        <p>ShieldX and all its content, features, and trademarks belong to SuMo Productivity Experts. You can't use our trademarks without permission.</p>

        <h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.</strong> We can't guarantee the app will work perfectly with all other apps or that it will block 100% of unwanted content. Technology changes, and the effectiveness of blocking features may vary.</p>

        <p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, SuMo Productivity Experts will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of ShieldX.</p>

        <p>We're not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Problems caused by your device, internet connection, or other apps</li>
            <li>Any damages from using or not being able to use ShieldX</li>
            <li>Content that gets through our blocking features</li>
            <li>Actions of third-party apps or services</li>
            <li>Any security breaches not directly caused by our negligence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Protection of Us (Indemnification)</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SuMo Productivity Experts from any claims, damages, or costs (including legal fees) arising from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or misuse of ShieldX</li>
            <li>Your violation of these terms</li>
            <li>Your violation of any law or rights of others</li>
            <li>Any content you create or share while using ShieldX</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to ShieldX immediately, without notice, if you violate these terms or for any other reason. Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your right to use ShieldX ends immediately</li>
            <li>You must delete the app from your device</li>
            <li>These terms continue to apply to your past use</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may also stop offering ShieldX entirely at any time without notice.</p>

        <h2>Changes and Updates</h2>
        <p>We may update ShieldX or these terms at any time. For significant changes to these terms, we'll give you 30 days notice through the app or email. Continued use means you accept the new terms.</p>

        <h2>Disputes</h2>
        <p>If you have a dispute with us, please contact us first at sumoproductivityexperts@gmail.com to try to resolve it informally.</p>
        
        <p>For any legal disputes that cannot be resolved informally, you agree not to participate in class action lawsuits against us and to resolve disputes individually.</p>

        <h2>General Terms</h2>
        <p>If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest remains in effect. Our failure to enforce any term doesn't waive our right to enforce it later. These terms, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between us.</p>

        <h2>Problems or Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have issues with ShieldX or questions about these terms, contact us at: <strong>sumoproductivityexperts@gmail.com</strong></p>
