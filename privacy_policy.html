        <h1>Privacy Policy for ShieldX</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 23, 2025</p>

        <p>SuMo Productivity Experts ("we," "us," or "our") operates the ShieldX mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

        <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

        <h4>Personal Data</h4>
        <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email address (if user logs in or provides it for support)</li>
            <li>User ID (if applicable, e.g., Firebase User ID)</li>
            <li>Device ID (for syncing settings or premium features)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Usage Data</h4>
        <p>We may also collect information that your device sends whenever you visit our Service or when you access the Service by or through a mobile device ("Usage Data").</p>
        <p>This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the features of our Service that you use, the time and date of your use, the time spent on those features, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.</p>
        <p>When you access the Service with a mobile device, this Usage Data may include information such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>

        <h4>Data from AccessibilityService API</h4>
        <p>ShieldX utilizes Android's AccessibilityService API to perform its core content blocking functions. This service allows ShieldX to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect URLs in browsers to evaluate against blocklists.</li>
            <li>Identify specific in-app content or features (like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) to apply user-configured blocking rules.</li>
            <li>Perform actions like navigating back or to the home screen when blocked content is detected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do NOT use the AccessibilityService API to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect personal or sensitive user data that is not directly related to the blocking functionality.</li>
            <li>Record audio or keystrokes.</li>
            <li>Change user settings without their consent.</li>
            <li>Circumvent Android privacy controls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data accessed via the AccessibilityService API is processed locally on your device for the sole purpose of content blocking as configured by you. We do not log or transmit this specific accessibility event data off your device for other purposes.</p>

        <h4>Data from NotificationListenerService</h4>
        <p>ShieldX may request access to the NotificationListenerService to enable features that suppress notifications from specific applications as configured by you within user-defined profiles or rules. When this feature is enabled, ShieldX can access notification content only for the purpose of identifying the source application and determining if its notifications should be suppressed according to your settings. We do not log or store the content of your notifications.</p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>SuMo Productivity Experts uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain our Service (e.g., core blocking functionality)</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our Service</li>
            <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so</li>
            <li>To provide customer support</li>
            <li>To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our Service</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
            <li>To provide you with advertising (as disclosed below)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>We may use third-Party Service Providers to show advertisements to you to help support and maintain our Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Google AdMob is provided by Google Inc. You can opt-out from AdMob by Google service by following the instructions described by Google: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a></p>
        <p>For more information on how Google uses the collected information, please visit the "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or app" page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> or visit Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>ShieldX uses Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to collect and manage consent for personalized advertising for users in regions where applicable (such as the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland). When you first use the app, you may be presented with a consent form allowing you to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads. You can update your consent choices at any time through the app settings.</p>
        <p>If you choose non-personalized ads, we will still display advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your interests based on personal data. This may affect the relevance of ads you see.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
        <p>Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

        <p>ShieldX stores the following data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally on your device</strong>: Block lists, profiles, rules, settings, and block event history</li>
            <li><strong>On our servers (via Firebase Firestore)</strong>: If you enable sync functionality, your profiles, rules, and settings may be synchronized across your devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Block event history is automatically pruned based on your retention settings in the app. All local data can be removed by uninstalling the app or clearing app data through your device settings.</p>

        <h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United States and process it there.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p>SuMo Productivity Experts will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.</p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>
